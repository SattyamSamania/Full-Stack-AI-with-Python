# Full Stack Python with AI & ML

This repository is a collection of my **Python practice and projects**,  
ranging from basic programming to **AI agents, machine learning frameworks, and full-stack applications**.

It is designed to demonstrate growth from **core Python skills â†’ applied AI/ML â†’ end-to-end full-stack development**.
